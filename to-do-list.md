DEPLOY APP
- There are many ways to deploy a React application. The create-react-app docs go into detail on some of the options.
- We recommend Netlify. Instructions for deploying an app with Netlify can be found at: https://notes.northcoders.com/courses/js-front-end/hosting.

README.md
- Make sure that your README includes the following:
A link to the deployed version.
General info about your app, a brief description of what the project is, and how to use your app.
A link to your back end repo.
The minimum version of Node required to run locally. You can check your Node version using node --version in your terminal.
Clear instructions on how to run your project locally, e.g. git clone <repo-url>, cd..., etc.
