Refactoring To Do List

- Use axios queries instead of functions in api
- Amend article votes to be a generic vote component to cover all article/comment votes
- Refactor wireframe and component tree
- Update the comment state with the output of the post request, as currently can only see comment if we refresh the page
- Implement a message to inform users if the post fails.
- Implement functionality to prevent multiple clicks on the post button while the request is in progress.
- When deleting ensure that delete message stays for every comment that delete button has been clicked
